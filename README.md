A dictionary with a handful of fun facts & flash cards

**Built with**
- React JS
- Tailwind CSS
- free dictionary API
- Random word API

**Features**
- get the definition & an example of searched words in a sentence
- features compenents that randomly generate new words & trivia

**Purpose**
- After looking for Apis to use in a project I came across a few dictionary apis which sounded like a nice project to get more used to React & tailwind with. To make my dictionary site more unique I looked for more APIs that could fit in with a dictionary. I ended up picking APIs that gave intersting trivia as I felt it would inspire the user with more words to search up.
