A dictionary with a handful of fun facts 

**Built with**
- React JS
- Tailwind CSS
- free dictionary API
- Random word API
- number trivia API
- useless facts API

**Features**
- get definition & example of searched words

**Purpose**
- After looking for Apis to use for a project I came across a few dictionary apis which sounded like a nice project to get more used to React & tailwind with. To make my dictionary more unique I looked for more APIis that could fit in a dictionary. I ended up picking APIs that gave intersting trivia as I felt it would inspire the user with more words they would want to search up & it is also fun to know more random facts.
